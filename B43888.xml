            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>To all Ingenious Lovers of musicK.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Might at well endeavour to perswade, that the Sun is a glorious, and beneficial Planet; as take pains to Illustrate Musick with my imperfect praises; for every reasonable Mans own mind will be its Advocate. Musick, belov'd of Heaven, for it is the business of Angels; Desired on Earth as the most charming pleasure of Men. The world contains nothing that is good, but what is full of Harmonious Concord, nor nothing that is evil, but it is opposite, as being the ill favour'd production of Discord and Disorder. I dare affirm, those that love not Musick (if there be any such) are Dissenters from Ingenuity, and Rebels to the Monarchy of Reason.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:208408:3"/>
            <p>Of the kinds of Musick, Vocal has always had the Preference in esteem: and by consequence the Recorder (as approaching nearest to the sweet delightfulness of the Voice) ought to have the first place in Opinion as we see by the Ʋniversal use of it confirm'd.</p>
            <p>For the assistance and improvement of all the Lovers of it, I have with great care made this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the Best and Newest Tunes extant; and for the advantage of Beginners, that have not the help of a Master to Instruct them, I have placed in the beginning some easy Tunes with Dots un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Violin Notes, by which means they may confirm themselves in the manner of Playing every Note.</p>

               <p>THE first thing that I desire you to observe, is the way of holding your <hi>Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> when you Play, for it is a great matter in the helping you to play readily, and except you are diligent at the first to learn what is directed here; but through your own negligence you get some ill way, which will be harder to leave, than to learn the Right; but to prevent you in such a fault, is the cause of my putting you in mind, before I proceed to the Directions.</p>

                  <head>Of holding the Recorder.</head>
                  <p>HOld your <hi>Recorder</hi> with your left hand next your Mouth, putting your second Finger of your left hand on the third hole, then put your third Finger of your right hand on the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:208408:4"/> seventh hole with the Thumb of your right hand underneath, the which Finger and Thumb held thus, are for a stay to keep it to your Mouth, and to make it more tuneable, and also to keep your Fingers in Order over the rest of the holes. These things being observed, and done right, you may proceed and try to play the first Example.</p>

                  <head>The manner of playing on the <hi>Recorder</hi> the Dot way.</head>
                  <p>THere are two ways of setting Tunes for the <hi>Recorder</hi> the Dot way; some sets them on seven Lines, some on six, which is the general way, and it is in my opinion, the best, for more do but hinder the readiness of sight, and when the other two are wanted I make a short line underneath; and these six Lines are appropriated to the first six Holes of the Pipe; and the first hole is, that underneath which you must stop with your Thumb, and the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Line belongs to that hole; the second hole is the next to that above the <hi>Recorder,</hi> and you are to stop that with your first Finger, and the second line is for that; the third is to be stopt with your second Finger, and the third Line is for that; the fourth hole is to be stopt with your third Finger, and the fourth Line is for that; the fift hole is to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:208408:4"/> be stopt with the first Finger of your right hand, and the fifth Line is for that; the sixth hole is to be stopt with your second Finger of your right hand, and the sixth Line is for that. The seventh hole is to be stopt with your third finger of your right hand which must be kept on in all but pincht Notes, both for the Commodious holding of your Pipe, and for the true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Notes, for which reason the second finger of your left hand must likewise be kept on in all Notes but <hi>Ela.</hi> The eighth hole is stopt with the little finger of your right hand. But to instruct you Better in these, I have set the first example of the Eight Notes ascending and descending on seven Lines only, to make you understand the right holding of the <hi>Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> for the playing the rest of the Tunes.</p>

                  <p>YOur Pinching Notes ascend higher than the plain Notes, and are distinguished from them by a dash drawn through the first Dot on the uppermost Line, making it as a Cross; as in the following example you may see, to play these on the <hi>Recorder,</hi> you must bend your left Thumb, and let it be half over the hole underneath the Pipe, for that belongs to the upper Line, where the pinch is made, and pinch the Nail of your Thumb in the hole, then blow your <hi>Recorder</hi> a little stronger than you did when you played the other Notes, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:208408:6"/> you shall find the <hi>Recorder</hi> sound eight Notes higher, all the other stops are the same as the former.</p>

                  <head>Directions for the Graces on the <hi>Recorder.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IN the following Example of Graces this  is the Character of a Beat, and is performed by shaking your Finger upon that hole which Line where it stands directs, and leaving it on; this  is the Character of a Shake, and is performed by shaking your finger on the hole direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and leaving it off.  ͜  The third Made for a slur or slide, that is, when two or three Notes are tyed together by a crooked dash underneath, then those two or three Notes must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with one Breath. The fourth Grace is called a Slur and Beat, and is played thus, hit your first Note with the Tip of your Tongue, and continuing your Breath take up your second, and bring on the first Beating. The other Shake is the double Shake, and is played by shaking your fourth Finger of your left hand, holding those fingers on that the Dots belong to, both in the Example, and in the following Tunes. In the Tunes prickt with Violin Notes only, I have placed over the Notes that are to be shook on, this mark  , and over those that are to be shook off this  and for the double shake this </p>

                  <head>Of the Time or Proportion of the Notes.</head>
                  <p>THere is two sorts of Time which are used in the Tunes following, and they are called Common Time, and Tripple Time, the Common Time is multiplied by two; as one Semibrief is two Minnums, and a Minnum is two Crotchets, and a Crotchet two Quavers, and one Quaver is two Semiquavers. Now to know those that are Common Time from Tripple; observe, that those that are barr'd with the length of four Crotchets in each Barr, are Common Time; Tripple Time is multiplyed by three, the Notes having a prick added to it; as one Minnum with a prick is three Crotchets, and so is Barr'd with three or six in all Tunes that are Tripple Time. This you must observe, where you see a prick follow a Note, either in Tripple or Common Time, it adds half as much to that Note, which goes before it, as the length of the Note is, that is, if the Note be a Minnum, then the prick or tittle is a Crotchet, and so in all the rest of the Time, let the prick follow what time soever,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:208408:7"/> all the Examples are placed in the Page before the Tunes, being thought most convenient to lye before you when you first begin to play.</p>
                  <p>Observing further, that these Lessons set Dot-way if you have a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>For those that are minded to learn the Gammut-way, on this Instrument, I have set the Scale of Flats and Sharps the Page before these Tunes, that are set Both-ways, which with a small Observation, the Learner may soon attain to his satisfaction.</p>
